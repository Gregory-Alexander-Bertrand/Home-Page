# Home-Page
Here, I've combined my two favorite things, literature and coding and have made a mock-up homepage for a Literary Journal. There is a nav bar on top with empty
dropdown menus that would lead to different aspects of the website if real. Below that is a button where you would be able to order a hardcopy of the "current issue". Next to that is an excerpt from a blog submitted by "one of our staff." Finally, under that, are three links to online stories.
